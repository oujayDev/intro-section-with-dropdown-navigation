## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned more about CSS Flexbox, which the time I was first introduced to this topic I was really confused about. I also learned to use utility classes, which I'm going to do from now on everytime I start a new project as it makes my styling somewhat fast and easy. I'm also gonna add some of the JavaScript DOM methods I learned from this project.

I'm look forward for more frontend development projects in the future, along with new learnings!

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website helped me by providing the syntax I didn't know, mostly about JavaScript DOM.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is also an amazing learning resource I used for all of my projects.
